# postcards

A template project for creating a personal postcard site using the [postcards](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) R package.

## Overview

This repository contains a template for building a single-page personal website (postcard) using R Markdown and the postcards package. The site is automatically built and deployed using a custom GitHub Actions workflow.

## Getting Started


### Development Right on Github

1. For our class, accept the classroom project.  (If someone else wants to use this, fork or clone the project).
2. Working right on Github, edit `index.Rmd` with your personal information. Commit your changes (green button, top right, write a short message).
3. (Optional) Add a `profile.jpg` image to the root directory
4. Wait while Github works on rendering your site.  You can see this by going to the "Actions" tab. 

## Customization

### Editing Your Postcard

Edit the `index.Rmd` file to customize your postcard:
- Update the `title` field with your name
- Add your profile image filename to the `image` field
- Update social links under `links`
- Modify the Bio, Education, and Experience sections

### Changing the Template

The postcards package includes several templates:
- `trestles` (default)
- `jolla`
- `jolla-blue`
- `onofre`
- `solana`

To use a different template, change the `output` field in `index.Rmd`:
```yaml
output:
  postcards::jolla
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a custom GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-postcards.yml`) that:
1. Automatically builds the postcard site when changes are pushed to the `main` branch
2. Uploads the built site as an artifact
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages (optional)

### Enabling GitHub Pages

To deploy your postcard site to GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages
3. Select the `gh-pages` branch as the source
4. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
